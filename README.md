Welcome to the **BECKN O**pen **NE**twork

## What is it? 
Beckn One is a reference implementation of an Open Network powered by the Beckn Protocol. 


## What does it have? 
Architecturally it is not different from any other open network powered by beckn protocol. Out of the box, it contains: 

* A fully functional self serviced registry. 
* A Gateway.
* A BPP Testing tool in the form of a BAP. 
* A BAP Testing tool in the form of a BPP. 


Beckn application programmers can use the hosted instance of this repo at [this](https://beckn-one.succinct.in/) portal to validate their own  beckn implementation using the the test bpps (whose subscriber ids are of the form beckn-one.succinct.in.\*.BPP) or test baps (whose ids are of the form beckn-one.succinct.in.\*.BAP)  Developers can also use this portal to test each other's implemenation.
